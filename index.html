            <h3>3 Fluffy Felines</h3>

            Two of my cats are white and grey and one is grey striped. I have 2 boys and 1 female. All of them love to sleep all day and play at night. After sleeping they almost immediatly always want chicken treats. My cats are very vocal and love lots of attention.

            Two of my cats have been out of the country. One ragdoll and my scottish fold has been to London. The journey was very long for them and I don't think they like traveling. My youngest cat has not been out of the country and I don't think he would like it.

            <h3>What are they?</h3>

            I have two ragdolls and one scottish fold. One ragdoll is a boy and one is a female. My scottish fold is a boy. My female cat gets along with both male cats and my male cats do not enjoy each others company.

            I got all of my cats when they were kittens. I traveled to Sacramento to get my ragdolls and my partner traveled to Texas to get our scottish fold. Kittens are easy to travel with on planes.
